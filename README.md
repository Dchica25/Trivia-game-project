## Description

The user receives feedback in the browser and at the end of the game, a leaderboard is displayed for all participating users for that day showing their respective score and rank.

## Usage
To use the Trivia Game Project, the user lands on the home page which has a play button. The user clicks the play button which prompts user to enter their username. The user enters their preferred username, and they are redirected to the game page. The game page presents three levels to the user and allows them to choose between beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of trivia questions. When the user clicks on a preferred level, the timer starts, and the first question appears along with answer options to choose from. The options are labeled from A to B. When the user chooses a correct answer, the browser will display “correct,” and when they choose a wrong answer, the browser will display “wrong answer, the correct answer was ___.” When the user answers all the questions, the timer will stop, and the leaderboard will display. The leaderboard will display their score, username, level completed and rank in the game. The page also displays a “play again” button, which the user can click if they want to play again. The leaderboard data is stored in local storage and clears at the end of each day. Enjoy our game!
